/*
Suppose you have a web hosting provider that has different packages
If you wanted to use its data in Javascript, you had to assigne each
value to a different variable, which could be troublesome. 
A better approach is to create object with properties.

In the example present in book each hosting plan is a object with name
plan1, plan2, plan3. 
Each object has  5 properties name, price, space, transfer and pages
In this case each object has a string property (name) and 
four number properties(price, space, transfer and pages)

Properties are just variables that are attached to an object.
