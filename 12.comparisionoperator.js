/*
Comparision operator used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values. 
This will result in 'true' or 'false' only. Following are examples  "===", "<", ">", "!===", "<=", ">="
 
Both the signs are used for equality check. Try to use "===" sign

"==" => does not consider/check data type of two values/variables and compares them by converting the string in numeric.

"===" => checks datatype of the values/variables on both sides and if they are same then only it will compare.
