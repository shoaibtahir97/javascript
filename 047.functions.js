/*
A function is a block of JS code that does the same thing again and again.
Whenever you write a code it is executed line by line. 
It means that a code that is executed once will not execute again. 
If at a certain point you want to run that code again than you have to write that code again.
For example:-  Let's say you are calculating student grade using if else statements for one student you can use it once 
but for other students you have to make another if else statement, so you need something that could execute a block of code 
again and again when needed.
By the help of functions you can call that block of code/business logic and execute it again.
    
    Function create a block where you crete your logic, the function has a name, and using that name you call that function    
and when you call the function that block of code is executed. You can reuse code, define the code once and use it many times.
It saves you repetitive coding and makes your code easier to understand.
